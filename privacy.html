      <h1>PickleJoin Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: 2026-01-13</p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how PickleJoin ("we", "us") collects, uses, and shares information
        when you use our mobile app and services (the "Service").
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account info:</strong> email address for one-time password (OTP) authentication and, if used, Apple or Google sign-in.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile info you provide:</strong> name, skill level, and optional photo.</li>
        <li><strong>Location data:</strong> approximate or precise location (depending on device settings) to show nearby courts and sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Session and court data:</strong> sessions you create or join, and court details you submit.</li>
        <li><strong>Device info:</strong> push notification token, app version, and OS version.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage and logs:</strong> basic app events and error logs for reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To authenticate you and maintain your account.</li>
        <li>To show nearby courts, sessions, and players.</li>
        <li>To enable session creation, joining, and updates.</li>
        <li>To send push notifications you opt into or that relate to your sessions.</li>
        <li>To improve performance, prevent abuse, and debug issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        If you enable notifications, we use your device token to send updates such as session reminders,
        join/leave notices, and nearby activity. You can disable notifications anytime in device settings.
      </p>

      <h2>Location Data</h2>
      <p>
        Location helps us show courts and sessions near you. You can enter a location manually or turn off
        location access in your device settings. Some features may be limited without location.
      </p>

      <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with service providers that help us
        operate the Service, such as hosting and push notification providers. Examples include Supabase
        (data hosting) and Expo (push notifications).
      </p>

      <h2>User-Generated Content</h2>
      <p>
        Sessions and court details you create may be visible to other users. Please avoid sharing sensitive
        personal information. PickleJoin does not verify users or locations, and users are responsible for
        their own interactions and safety during in-person sessions.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain data as long as needed to provide the Service. You can delete your account in the app,
        which removes your profile and associated data, subject to legal or safety requirements.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Disable notifications in device settings.</li>
        <li>Turn off location access or use a manual location.</li>
        <li>Delete your account from the app settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable safeguards to protect your information, but no system is 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        PickleJoin is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal
        information, contact us to remove it.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new "Last updated" date.
      </p>
