    <h1>PickleJoin Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-01-13</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how PickleJoin ("we", "us") collects, uses,
      and shares information when you use our mobile app and services (the "Service").
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Account info: email address for one-time password (OTP) authentication.</li>
      <li>Profile info you provide: name, skill level, and optional photo.</li>
      <li>Location data: approximate or precise location to show nearby courts and sessions.</li>
      <li>Session and court data: sessions you create or join, and court details you submit.</li>
      <li>Device info: push notification token, app version, and OS version.</li>
      <li>Usage and logs: basic app events and error logs for reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To authenticate you and maintain your account.</li>
      <li>To show nearby courts, sessions, and players.</li>
      <li>To enable session creation, joining, and updates.</li>
      <li>To send push notifications you opt into or that relate to your sessions.</li>
      <li>To improve performance, prevent abuse, and debug issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      If you enable notifications, we use your device token to send updates such as
      session reminders, join/leave notices, and nearby activity. You can disable
      notifications anytime in device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Location Data</h2>
    <p>
      Location helps us show courts and sessions near you. You can enter a location
      manually or turn off location access in your device settings. Some features
      may be limited without location.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal data. We may share information with service providers
      that help us operate the Service, such as hosting and push notification providers.
      Examples include Supabase (data hosting) and Expo (push notifications).
    </p>

    <h2>User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>
      Sessions and court details you create may be visible to other users.
      Please avoid sharing sensitive personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain data as long as needed to provide the Service. You can delete your account
      in the app, which removes your profile and associated data, subject to legal or
      safety requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Disable notifications in device settings.</li>
      <li>Turn off location access or use a manual location.</li>
      <li>Delete your account from the app settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable safeguards to protect your information, but no system is
      100% secure.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      PickleJoin is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child
      has provided personal information, contact us to remove it.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version
      with a new "Last updated" date.
