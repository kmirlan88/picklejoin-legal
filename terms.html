      <h1>PickleJoin Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="meta">Last updated: 2026-01-13</p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the PickleJoin mobile app and related services
        (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old to use PickleJoin. If you are under 18, you must have permission
        from a parent or guardian.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Account</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for your account and any activity under it.</li>
        <li>You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date.</li>
        <li>You can delete your account in the app settings at any time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sessions and Courts</h2>
      <p>
        PickleJoin helps you discover and organize pickleball sessions at public courts. Sessions are
        user-generated and may change or be canceled at any time.
      </p>

      <h2>User Content</h2>
      <p>
        You may submit content such as session details, court information, and profile data ("User Content").
        You are responsible for the User Content you submit and for ensuring it is accurate and lawful.
      </p>
      <p>
        You grant PickleJoin a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to host, store, display, and
        use your User Content solely to operate, improve, and provide the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>No harassment, abuse, or discrimination.</li>
        <li>No illegal, harmful, or misleading content.</li>
        <li>No spam, scraping, or interference with the Service.</li>
        <li>No impersonation or unauthorized access to accounts.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Safety and Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        PickleJoin does not verify users or guarantee session attendance. You are responsible for your own
        safety and for evaluating the suitability of any session or court. Physical activity involves
        inherent risk.
      </p>

      <h2>Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        If you enable notifications, we may send alerts about sessions or nearby activity. You can disable
        notifications in your device settings.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        The Service relies on third-party providers for hosting, authentication, and notifications. Your use
        of the Service may also be subject to their terms and policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Termination</h2>
      <p>
        We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or pose a risk to the community. You
        may stop using the Service at any time and delete your account.
      </p>

      <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        The Service is provided <span class="mono">"as is"</span> without warranties of any kind. We do not
        guarantee that sessions will occur, that courts are available, or that the Service will be uninterrupted
        or error-free.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by law, PickleJoin and its operators are not liable for any indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes means you
        accept the updated Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where PickleJoin operates, without regard to
        conflict of law principles.
