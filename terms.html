    <h1>PickleJoin Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-01-13</p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the PickleJoin mobile app and
      related services (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 13 years old to use PickleJoin. If you are under 18, you must
      have permission from a parent or guardian.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Account</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for your account and any activity under it.</li>
      <li>You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date.</li>
      <li>You can delete your account in the app settings at any time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sessions and Courts</h2>
    <p>
      PickleJoin helps you discover and organize pickleball sessions at public courts.
      Sessions are user-generated and may change or be canceled at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>User Content</h2>
    <p>
      You may submit content such as session details, court information, and profile data.
      You are responsible for the content you submit and for ensuring it is accurate and lawful.
    </p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No harassment, abuse, or discrimination.</li>
      <li>No illegal, harmful, or misleading content.</li>
      <li>No spam, scraping, or interference with the Service.</li>
      <li>No impersonation or unauthorized access to accounts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Safety and Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      PickleJoin does not verify users or guarantee session attendance. You are responsible
      for your own safety and for evaluating the suitability of any session or court.
      Physical activity involves inherent risk.
    </p>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      If you enable notifications, we may send alerts about sessions or nearby activity.
      You can disable notifications in your device settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Service relies on third-party providers for hosting and notifications. Use of
      the Service may also be subject to their terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or pose a risk to
      the community. You may stop using the Service at any time and delete your account.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We do not guarantee
      that sessions will occur, that courts are available, or that the Service will be
      uninterrupted or error-free.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by law, PickleJoin and its operators are not liable
      for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising
      from your use of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after
      changes means you accept the updated Terms.
